We present our unofficial guide to Android app size and how to squeeze in as much useful functionality into your app in the smallest number of bytes. The SwiftKey team here in London has managed to halve our download and install size by investigating the root causes of bloat as well as taking advantages of the latest developments in Android. We’ve done this whilst continuing to support over 350 languages, 200 themes, 200 keyboard layouts, handwriting recognition, translator, emoji prediction and loads more.
