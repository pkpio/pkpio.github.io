2020 has been a tough year for most of us. It's been nearly a year since I have last done the activites I enjoy so much - travel, volleyball, meeting friends and family. Rather than resenting everything I didn't get to do this year, I'm going to talk about all that has gone well this year for me. Turns out, when I really start looking, I can find the good even in a year such as this. 

Before I go on, I would like to recognise all those who suffer from the pandemic - economically, psychologically, financially and in health. And a big thanks to the essential workers and those of you who follow the health recommendations. Now, moving on to all that has gone well.


New Home
----
I consider myself incredibly lucky that I moved to a new home at the start of this year before all the chaos began. The joy of owning the first home definitely kept me occupied with many aspects that come along with it such as furnishing, decorating and other improvements. 


Home automation
----
I always dreamed of making the space I live in smart - generally being aware of basic intents like turning lights on and off, opening and closing curtains. It's hard to justify building such a setup in a rented home - to many limitations and the work doesn't exactly translate to a new home if you move. Being at home gave me back plenty of extra time to indulge myself in achieving this dream to a reasonable extent. Working on this, the first couple of months went by in a blip. My home automation setup is fully open sourced - [https://github.com/praveendath92/home-lab](https://github.com/praveendath92/home-lab), and I intend to talk about it in detail in a future post - about my idea of a smart home and how I acheived it.
