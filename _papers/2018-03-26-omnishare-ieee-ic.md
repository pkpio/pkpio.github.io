Abstract
----
Two attractive features of cloud storage services are the automatic synchronization of files between multiple client devices and the possibility to share files with other users. However, many users are concerned about the security and privacy of data stored in the cloud. Client-side encryption is an effective safeguard, but requires all client devices to have the decryption key. Current solutions derive these keys from user-chosen passwords, which are easily guessed. We present OmniShare, the first scheme to combine strong client-side encryption with intuitive key distribution mechanisms to enable access from multiple client devices and sharing between users. OmniShare uses a novel combination of out-of-band channels, including QR codes and ultrasonic communication, as well as the cloud storage service itself, to authenticate new devices. We describe the design and implementation of OmniShare, and explain how we evaluated its security (using formal methods), its performance (benchmarks), and its usability (cognitive walkthrough).
