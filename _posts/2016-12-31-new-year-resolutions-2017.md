Just a few more hours and all things 2016 will be history. While I'm not into the custom of writing year end notes and public resolutions for upcoming year, I like to make an exception here - there's always a first, right? If I were to speak my thoughts spontaneously, 2016 hasn't been a great year for me - I hate to go into the reasons but needless to say that it's been one of the "slowest years"!

> You can't change your past but you can learn from it and change your future.

So I have decided to make some realistic new year resolutions for the upcoming year. Hopefully I would be able to keep up to my personal expectations - fingers crossed.

1. Physical
---------------
==1000 Kilometres in running by the end of the year.== 
That's about 4 KMs per day excluding weekends and a couple of extra days off. Doesn't seem like an ambitious goal, let's see how that goes. I also plan to make a Strava widget to track the cumulative progress through the year - obviously this is not part of the resolution.

2. Professional
---------------
==Find an exciting job and best efforts for the Big 4.==
I would be graduating officially in the first quarter of 2017 so, this is probably a typical resolution for a soon to graduate. I intend to devote my full attention at preparing and doing my best at getting to one of the Big 4, 5 or whatever but let's see how that goes.

3. Personal
-----------------
==More Machine Learning and AI.==
Okay, clearly this is a nerdy goal to place in personal section of resolutions but yeah, I hope to improve my knowledge in the area of Machine Learning, Neural Networks and AI. Hopefully I will have a personal project, at least started, in one or more of these areas by the end of 2017. To this end, I have just finished my first course in [Machine Learning](ml-certi) today.

4. Social
-----------------
==More clubs, pubs and social events?==
Well, I really haven't thought about this one yet. I want to be realistic with my goals so, I'm not going to put any social resolutions for the upcoming year - doesn't have to mean I would be anti social! I do want to learn Forr√≥ or some other kind dance but yeah, not a hard goal!

I'm excited about the unknown and the possibilities it has in store. <i>Optimistically welcoming 2017! :v:</i>
