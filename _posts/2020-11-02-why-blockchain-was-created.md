Blockchain is indubitably one of the greatest technological creations in our time. But so are many other things we created such as Internet and Artificial intelligence. It's easy to grasp the significance of Internet because we use it every day in many ways - bringing us morning weather report to evening entertainment, and everything in between. We also realize the power of AI because we experience it everyday - searching online, detecting faces in pictures, and product recommendations. We understand these already ubiquitous technologies because we can associate them to the problems they solve in our day to day life. Blockchain is a relatively young kid in the block so, in order to understand or appreciate it, we have to look at the problems it aims to solve.

Blockchain is the technology that enables the existence of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is the first and most popular cryptocurrency, the one which for which blockchain was invented. Now, to understand why Bitcoin was created, we have to understand the drawbacks in our current financial system. For the sake of completeness and to get a sense of how we got to the current system, we will take a quick walk along the history of how money evolved over time. If you wish, you may skip the history lesson and jump to [issues with Fiat currencies](#issues-with-fiat-currencies){: .btn}


Barter system
----
![barter-system](/assets/images/blog/barter-system.jpg){: .align-left} 

People exchanged goods and services directly with each other. For example a farmer with excess produce of dairy or meat could exchange with a fisherman with surplus of fish. This was likely the first system to facilitate trade - which is always essential as no one can be self sufficient at all times. 

The problem with this system was immediately apparent when there is no one willing to participate on the other side of the trade - trade is bilateral. In our earlier example, if no fisherman wants to trade fish for meat or dairy, the farmer wouldn't be able to get fish even though there is value for his meat and dairy. Some of these issues could be solved by involving 3 or more parties in a trade but it gets complicated quickly - like in the board game [Catan](https://www.catan.com/game/catan).  


Commodity money
----
![commodity-money](/assets/images/blog/commodity-money.jpg){: .align-center} 

As time passed, people noticed that certain commodities such as sea shells, salt, corn, copper, silver, and gold are rare and always attractive. People began to quote value of their everyday items in terms of these commodities. For example:

- a sheep is worth 10 sea shells 
- a house is worth 50 bags of corn

This is an improvement over the barter system as people could sell their goods and services for these commodities. And they can buy the goods and services they need using these commodities. The commodities used for trade had certain characteristics: they were widely desired and, therefore valuable. They were also durable, portable, and easily stored. While this opened up more opportunities for trade, there were still issues with the commodities such as:

- _Deterioration_: certain commodities, like corn, can deteriorate in quality over time
- _Bulkiness_: Imagine having to go shopping with a cart full of salt
- _Indivisibility_: some commodities, like sea shell, can't be meaningfully sub divided 


Coins
----
![coin-money](/assets/images/blog/coin-money.jpg){: .align-center} 

People became accustomed to the idea of a medium of exchange for goods and services - aka money. Coins were minted with different denominations and this solved much of the problems  associated with commodities. Also, the value of the coin is decoupled from its size and this made the process of moving money around easier. This innovation made it easier and faster to conduct trade.

Paper money
----
![paper-money](/assets/images/blog/paper-money.jpg){: .align-center}

Merchants and traders were looking for ways to do larger transactions without having to carry large amounts of metal coins so, paper money was created. Bank notes were issued and backed by storing coins of equal value. Anyone holding a bank note could approach the bank and exchange for its value in coins. 

> The modern paper money such as Dollar, Euro, and Pound are no longer backed by any physical commodity or asset.

Paper money is now issued by a central financial entity in each country and __money derives its value from the trust we place in these institutions__. This is called __Fiat money__.


Plastic money
----
![plastic-money](/assets/images/blog/plastic-money.png){: .align-center}

Plastic money was an improvement over paper money. It made it easy to transact on large or small amounts alike. It also opened up plethora of new possibilities such as credit cards that made short term borrowing easier. Coupled with the innovations on the internet, it created products and services that wouldn't have been possible without it.

Plastic money is just a representation of paper money that offers convenient means to transact with ease. The fundamental issues, discussed in the next section, apply to all forms of fiat currencies - such as US Dollar, Euro, Pound. 


Issues with Fiat currencies
----
To understand the issues with fiat currencies, we need to take a closer look at its definition.

> Fiat money is a government-issued currency that isn't backed by a commodity such as gold. 

Fiat money gives central banks greater control over the economy because they can control how much money is printed. Central banks printing too much over a short period has led to a total economic collapse time and again.

- [Hyperinflation in Germany in 1920s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_the_Weimar_Republic)
- [Hyperinflation in Zimbabwe in 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe)
- [Hyperinflation in Venezuela in 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Venezuela)


{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/blog/Zimbabwe_Hyperinflation_2008_notes.jpg" caption="Zimbabwe banknotes ranging from 10 dollars to 100 billion dollars printed within a one-year period" %}

Just in the last century there were [13 instances of Hyperinflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation#Notable_hyperinflationary_periods) - Austria, Bolivia, Brazil, China, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Malaya, North Korea, Peru, Poland, Philippines, Soviet Union, and Venezuela. Through no fault of their own, people in these countries had seen their money erode in value as __price of commodities doubled every 14.82 hours__ (Hungary, July 1946)! All because the central banks hoped to print their way out of trouble. Hyperinflation is an extreme scenario and is typically associated with some form of War.

During times of crisis - be it war, economic collapse, or pandemic such as the one we are in now, central banks issue unprecedented amounts of money in a short span to support and boost the recovery of economy. As cool (and unwise) as it would be, this newly created wealth is _not dropped from a blimp._ 

{% include video id="mrvD1QpJyYU?start=0:36" provider="youtube" %}

The government decides which institutions will receive a bigger chunk of that wealth - in the name of aid, bail out or a rescue package. In the 2008 financial crisis, it was bailing out banks, despite their own faults for the situation - as these banks were "_essential to keep the financial system running._" A similar situation in the 2020 crisis. In US, [large corporations get 25% of the $2 trillion stimulus package](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-anatomy-of-the-2-trillion-covid-19-stimulus-bill/). Fiat money gives this unprecedented powers to the governments or central banks to do such massive re-distribution of wealth - further widening the income gaps in the society. Re-enforcing the saying:

> The rich get richer and the poor get poorer

Bitcoin
----
The issues related to the handling of 2008 financial crisis was the reason why Bitcoin was created. __On 3 January 2009, the bitcoin network came into existence with Satoshi Nakamoto mining the genesis block of bitcoin__. Embedded in this block was the text:

> The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks. 

To summarize, Bitcoin was created in the hopes of building a new form of money that is not controlled by a single central entity - such as the central banks. A system where no single person, company or even government has the capacity to manipulate the supply of money. Bitcoin runs on a fully decentralized system. News coins are issued at a defined rate and are distributed in a well defined structure.


Blockchain
----
One major difference between physical and digital forms of money is that a digital token can duplicated or falsified and spent over and over - called the __Double spend problem__. This applies to both digital versions of Fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Fiat currencies can solve this easily because there is a trusted central entity - either your bank or the central bank, which keeps a record of how much money each person has and every time they try to spend money, their account is checked to make sure they have enough balance before approving the transaction. With Bitcoin there are no central entities that can provide this service so, a noval technology called blockchain was invented to workaround the double spending problem.

Although blockchain was invented for supporting a new form of decentralized money such as Bitcoin, the underlying technology can be used for many applications beyond creation of  cryptocurrencies. The original version of the Internet was created to allow multiple computers to communicate on a single network, and today it has evolved into something much bigger than anyone could have imagined. Blockchain has the potential to be something much bigger! The next post will discuss how blockchain works and how it can be used to power many new types of applications.
