Welcome to my little page on the Web. Here, you will find a few bits of information about myself, written in first person.

Nice to see you here! As much as I like to keep this site up-to-date, it's a very real possiblility that I may not. If you are here to recruit me, checkout my Linkedin page for, likely, latest information on how I try to "sell" myself. In any case, feel free to look around. There's also a blog here that I like to write some of thoughts in. If you find something interesting in there, you can always open up a discussion using comments. And before you go, thanks for stopping by!
